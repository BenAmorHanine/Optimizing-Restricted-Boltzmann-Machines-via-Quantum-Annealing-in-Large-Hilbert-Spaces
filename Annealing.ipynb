    "# Quantum Boltzmann Machines\n",
    "The `qbm` Python package is designed for training and analyzing quantum Boltzmann machines (QBMs) using either a simulation or a D-Wave quantum annealer.\n",
    "The QBM implemented here is based on the work in *Quantum Boltzman Machine* by Amin et al. [[1]](#1).\n",
    "This package originated as part of the thesis [*Quantum Boltzmann Machines: Applications in Quantitative Finance*](https://github.com/cameronperot/qbm-quant-finance).\n",

    "## Installation\n",
    "The `qbm` package can be installed with\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install qbm\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Configuration\n",
    "The `qbm` package is mainly configured around the project directory, which can be set with the `QBM_PROJECT_DIR` environment variable.\n",
    "Once the environment variable is set one can use the `qbm.utils.get_project_dir()` function to get a path object to the directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### BQRBM Model\n",
    "The BQRBM, or bound-based quantum restricted Boltzmann machine, is a quantum Boltzmann machine that has intra-layer restrictions and is trained via maximization of the log-likelihood lower bound.\n",
    "The model currently only has the ability to train in the specific case where `s_freeze = 1`, i.e., when it reduces to a classical RBM trained with quantum assistance, because estimating the effective inverse temperature is nontrivial for the general case.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the arguments to the methods below are further explained in their respective docstrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instantiation\n",
    "A BQRBM model can be instantiated as (for example)\n",
    "```\n",
    "model = BQRBM(\n",
    "    V_train,\n",
    "    n_hidden,\n",
    "    A_freeze,\n",
    "    B_freeze,\n",
    "    beta_initial=1.0,\n",
    "    simulation_params={\"beta\": 1.0},\n",
    "    seed=0,\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "One needs to choose whether or not they want to train a model using a simulation or an annealer, and this is done by passing either `simulation_params` or `annealer_params`.\n",
    "Whichever is passed decides how the model is trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Training\n",
    "The model can be trained by running\n",
    "```\n",
    "model.train(\n",
    "    n_epochs=100,\n",
    "    learning_rate=1e-1,\n",
    "    learning_rate_beta=1e-1,\n",
    "    mini_batch_size=10,\n",
    "    n_samples=10_000,\n",
    "    callback=None,\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sampling\n",
    "The model can generate samples by running\n",
    "```\n",
    "model.sample(\n",
    "    n_samples,\n",
    "    answer_mode=\"raw\",\n",
    "    use_gauge=True,\n",
    "    binary=False,\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Saving and Loading\n",
    "The model can be saved with\n",
    "```\n",
    "model.save(\"/path/to/model.pkl\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "and loaded again with\n",
    "```\n",
    "model = BQRBM.load(\"/path/to/model.pkl\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "An example notebook can be found [here](example/qbm_example.ipynb)\n",
